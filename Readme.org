Never miss any interesting tech meetups and your opportunity to connect and learn.
#+END_QUOTE

Its hard to navigate via UI in meetup.com and lu.ma. Meetups/Events are one of the easy way to connect, learn and explore interesting ideas/projects with awesome people.
And I love cli, so i built to explore meetups on different platforms.
